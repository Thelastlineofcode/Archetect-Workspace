# Archetect: Founder Proposal & Business Plan

**Personality Intelligence Platform for the Modern Workforce**

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** November 2025 | **Status:** Pre-Funding

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Archetect** is a personality intelligence platform that delivers unprecedented accuracy in understanding human communication styles and team dynamics. We combine the scientific rigor of Big Five psychology with symbolic intelligence frameworks to create profiles that feel "uncannily accurate"so accurate that users wonder how our proprietary algorithms work.

### The Opportunity

The personality assessment market is growing at 15% CAGR, reaching $6.5B by 2028. However, existing solutions face critical limitations:

- **Generic**: Surface-level insights that feel like horoscopes
- **Expensive**: Enterprise tools cost $50-200 per assessment
- **Limited Integration**: Poor CRM and workflow integration
- **Corporate-Only**: Alienate spiritually-aligned modern workforce

Archetect addresses these gaps with:

1. **Multi-layer intelligence**: Deeper accuracy than competitors
2. **Dual-approach architecture**: Serving both corporate and spiritual markets
3. **Native integrations**: HubSpot, Salesforce, Chrome, email platforms
4. **Flexible pricing**: Free tier to $500+/mo enterprise

### The Ask

**Seeking: $1.5M Seed Round**

- **Use of Funds**: Product development (60%), go-to-market (25%), operations (15%)
- **Timeline**: 18-month runway to Series A
- **Valuation**: $6M pre-money
- **Traction Target**: 10K users, $50K MRR at Series A

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
